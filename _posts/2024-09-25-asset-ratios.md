Several ratios are commonly used by traders and economists to gauge the strength of the economy and market conditions. Hereâ€™s a list of important ratios that can provide valuable insights:

1. US 10-Year Yield vs. US 2-Year Yield (Yield Curve Spread)
   What it indicates: The difference between long-term and short-term bond yields (e.g., 10-year minus 2-year) reflects investor expectations of future interest rates and economic growth.
   Inversion signal: If the yield curve inverts (short-term yields are higher than long-term yields), it can signal a possible recession.
2. Gold/Copper Ratio
   What it indicates: This ratio compares the price of gold (a safe-haven asset) to copper (an industrial metal sensitive to economic activity). A rising gold/copper ratio may indicate economic weakness, while a falling ratio suggests economic strength and growth.
3. S&P 500 / VIX (Fear-Greed Ratio)
   What it indicates: This ratio compares the performance of the stock market (S&P 500) to the volatility index (VIX, which measures market fear). A high ratio means markets are calm, while a low ratio suggests fear and market stress.
4. US Dollar Index (DXY) / Commodities (e.g., Oil, Gold)
   What it indicates: The US Dollar Index measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major currencies. Comparing it to commodities like oil or gold can show the relationship between the dollar's strength and commodity prices (commodities often move inversely to the USD).
5. Copper/Crude Oil Ratio
   What it indicates: Copper is closely tied to industrial demand, while crude oil is tied to both industrial activity and broader economic conditions. A rising copper/crude oil ratio can indicate strong industrial demand relative to energy costs, potentially signaling economic growth.
6. Earnings Yield / Bond Yield (Fed Model)
   What it indicates: The earnings yield of stocks (inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) is compared to bond yields, usually the 10-year US Treasury yield. If the earnings yield is higher than bond yields, stocks may be undervalued compared to bonds, making equities more attractive.
7. Gold/Silver Ratio
   What it indicates: This ratio compares the price of gold to silver. A high ratio (gold is expensive relative to silver) can indicate market fear or risk aversion, as investors move into safe-haven assets like gold. A falling ratio suggests higher risk appetite and economic optimism.
8. Corporate Bond Spread (Investment Grade vs. High Yield)
   What it indicates: The difference in yields between investment-grade bonds (safer) and high-yield (riskier) bonds reflects investor risk appetite. Widening spreads suggest increased concern about credit risk and economic weakness, while tightening spreads indicate more confidence in economic conditions.
9. Baltic Dry Index (BDI)
   What it indicates: This index measures the cost of shipping raw materials across the world. It is a leading indicator of global economic activity. A rising BDI suggests increasing demand for raw materials and a strengthening global economy, while a falling BDI signals weakness.
10. US 10-Year Treasury Yield / S&P 500 Dividend Yield
    What it indicates: This ratio compares the yield on US government bonds to the dividend yield of the stock market (S&P 500). If the bond yield is higher, bonds may be more attractive than stocks, and if stock dividends yield more, equities may be a better investment.
11. Consumer Discretionary / Consumer Staples Ratio (Cyclicals/Defensives)
    What it indicates: This compares the performance of consumer discretionary stocks (cyclical) to consumer staples stocks (defensive). A rising ratio indicates optimism and growth, as investors favor riskier cyclical sectors. A falling ratio signals risk aversion, with preference for defensive sectors.
12. High-Yield Bond ETF (HYG) / Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)
    What it indicates: The ratio of high-yield corporate bonds (HYG) to long-term Treasury bonds (TLT) reflects investor risk appetite. A rising ratio suggests confidence in corporate credit and risk-taking behavior, while a declining ratio indicates risk aversion and a preference for safer assets.
13. Oil/Gold Ratio
    What it indicates: This ratio compares the price of crude oil to gold. A rising oil/gold ratio can indicate that inflationary pressures from energy costs are rising, while a falling ratio suggests reduced inflation expectations or weaker demand for energy.
14. ISM Manufacturing Index / ISM Non-Manufacturing Index
    What it indicates: This compares the strength of the manufacturing sector to the services sector. A rising ratio suggests manufacturing is outpacing services, while a falling ratio suggests services are leading.
15. Retail Sales Growth / Consumer Price Index (CPI)
    What it indicates: Comparing retail sales growth to inflation (CPI) can provide insights into consumer spending power and inflation-adjusted economic growth.
