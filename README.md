# jekyll-simple

## simple
simple is a theme designed for blogger using static site generator like jekyll, Hexo etc.

Especially for those who writes in both Chinese and English. The font-type setting looks really good when writers use Chinese mixed with English.

Supposedly, this could work with Japanese as well but never had a chance to try.

## Story behind this theme

It has been long that using font with Chinese in web was a tedious and time-consuming work. It would be almost impossible to make different OS or devices to look the same.

iOS 9 has pulished some new fonts in Chinese and I decided to make one theme that looks good on iOS devices, at the same time, making it acceptable on computers using other fonts.

So mobile goes first, then the macOS.
